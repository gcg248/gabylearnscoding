  <p>Dolly was born on February 20th, 2022 at an Amish puppy mill in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. After three months living in disastrous conditions at the puppy mill, where she was sometimes locked in a cage for hours without food or water, the mill gave her up to a local dog shelter called <a href="https://www.dvgrr.org" target="_blank">Delaware Valley Golden Retriever Rescue</a>. This was where I found Dolly's picture and decided to give her a home. By the time I was approved and picked her up, Dolly was four months old.</p>

  <p>Because of her traumatic past, Dolly has separation anxiety, which is difficult to handle as her owner. Overall, her main downfalls are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>bully sticks</li>
    <li>jumping on counters</li>
    <li>being alone</li>
  </ul>

  <p>However, despite these separation issues, Dolly is one of the kindest dogs I have ever been around, and can interact lovingly with all other dogs and humans, including very young children and even babies. Goldendoodles are known for having these kinds of characteristics that make them appealing to families. Some of Dolly's core characteristics are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>sensitive</li>
    <li>charismatic</li>
    <li>silly</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These are just Dolly's specific traits. Learn more about broad characteristics of Goldendoodles and their tendencies, check out this page: <a href="goldendoodle.html">What is a Goldendoodle?</a></p>
