  <p>Dolly was born on February 20th, 2022 at an Amish puppy mill in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. After three months living in poor conditions, the mill gave her up to <a href="https://www.dvgrr.org" target="_blank">Delaware Valley Golden Retriever Rescue</a>, where I found her and decided to give her a home. She was four months old when I picked her up.</p>

  <p>Because of her traumatic past, Dolly has separation anxiety. Her main downfalls are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>bully sticks</li>
    <li>jumping on counters</li>
    <li>being alone</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Despite these issues, Dolly is one of the kindest dogs I have ever been around. Her core characteristics are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>sensitive</li>
    <li>charismatic</li>
    <li>silly</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These are just Dolly's traits. Learn more about Goldendoodles here: <a href="goldendoodle.html">What is a Goldendoodle?</a></p>
